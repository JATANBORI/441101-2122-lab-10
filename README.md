# Practice Lab 10: Struct and Enum Types
The goal of this lab is to introduce structs. Structs allow you to combine several variables that belong together to make a new type. There is a lot more you can do with structs, but for now, we will just think of them as a custom data type

There is an assessment BLOCK (L10.5 and L10.6) included with this Lab, which you should attempt. The BLOCK will form part of your portfolio submission for this module, which is assessed at the end of the trimester. For detail on how to submit your portfolio, see the assignment brief on Canvas.
